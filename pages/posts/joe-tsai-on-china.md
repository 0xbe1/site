# 蔡崇信答记者问

## 前言

2021 年 6 月 15 日，蔡崇信接受了美国媒体 CNBC 的采访，谈及中国的人权问题和香港问题。以下是 CNBC 发布的[采访实录](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/15/cnbc-exclusive-cnbc-transcript-alibaba-co-founder-executive-vice-chairman-brooklyn-nets-owner-joe-tsai-speaks-with-cnbcs-squawk-box-today.html)中的相关问答。

## 问答

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: And whether and how you can speak out about for example, human rights abuses in China? It’s a hard one, I know.

JOE TSAI: You have to be specific on what human rights abuse you’re talking about because the China that I see the, the large number of the population, I’m talking about 80%, 90% of the population are very, very happy with the fact that their lives are improving every year. When I started Alibaba in 1999, the GDP per capita was $800 in China. Today is over $10,000. And if you talk to a parent in, you know, in China and you ask them, are your children going to have a better life than you are, most of them will say, absolutely, yes. They are going to be educated, they’re going to find good jobs, the economy is expanding, right? So I’d like you to be more specific on that.

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: So let me ask it to you in this way though, there are a lot of American business leaders today that are being pushed by their employees, by consumers to say look, we’re taking a stand here on voting rights for example in the United States, you’re also doing business in China, you should be consistent right. Even Marco Rubio and others were actually criticizing American companies for what he was arguing was a hypocrisy. And when you talk to a lot of American business leaders, they say, look, I can speak out here but I know that I’m not in a position to speak out there because if I speak out there, it’s not that my hand is going to get slapped, it’s that my business is going to be damaged by the government because I’m just not allowed to do it.

JOE TSAI: Yeah, I think American companies, CEOs, understand this very well which is different cultures have different values and mores and in China you have different set of values, you also have a very different political system in that one single party dominates the governance of the country which, you know, whether you like it or not, there are some great benefits, like, China has managed to build a terrific infrastructure because there’s no politicking around whether you should build a highway from point A to point B, right? So, these are, these are all the benefits and the bottom line is, you have to look at the results, are people happy. When I look at China, the average citizen, citizen is very hopeful about the future. They’re happy about where they are. And, you know, I think that’s really-

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: But you read, but you read the same headlines that I do about some of the human rights issues, no?

JOE TSAI: I live in Hong Kong, right, so everybody is worried I still think it’s kind of funny that people call me up, you know, on these big zoom calls and say, Joe, where are you and I say I’m in Hong Kong and they say oh, are you okay, right? Well, over the last year, they impose the National Security Law. Hong Kong is one of the very few places that did not have national security legislation in place. What is this for? It’s against sedition, it’s against people that advocate splitting up Hong Kong as a separate country. These are things that are not allowed. You know why? Because Hong Kong used to be a colony, you know, a few 100 years ago, China lost Hong Kong to the Brits because of the Opium War. The British wanted to sell opium into China and as a result of some battles, China had to give, carve up Hong Kong, gave it up. This is a very scarring kind of history of China having foreign powers come in and carve up your territories. So, for, so if you put yourself in the Chinese people’s mindset, you know, if you’re a Chinese citizen, I look at this history, I want to make sure that we prevent foreign powers from carving up our territories. I think Hong Kong ought to be seen in that context, you know, I think there’s a lot of criticism of, you know, the democratic freedoms or freedoms of speech is being suppressed. But overall, since they instituted the National Security Law, everything is now stabilized. In 2019, when people were protesting on the streets, I was actually afraid to walk onto the street. You know why? Because I speak Mandarin and they were targeting every person that spoke Mandarin because they would assume that you come from the mainland. You know while I actually grew up in Taiwan where you know they speak Mandarin there. And so, I actually felt physically threatened with, with these protesters, right. So, I think now we have more stability. Hong Kong is going to be fine. You know why because it’s a free market economy. When you invest in Hong Kong, free flow of capital, you put money into the Hong Kong Stock Exchange today and in Hong Kong dollars, tomorrow you can take it out in US dollars. There’s a free flow of capital. It’s also, it also has the most benign tax system there is for capital formation. The income tax rate is only 15% and then there’s no capital gains rate, no taxes on capital gains, dividends, and so if you want to invest in Hong Kong, great for capital formation.

## 总结

蔡崇信提出的几个观点，我是认同的。

- 中国的父母普遍相信子女会比自己过上更好的生活。
- 中国的经济在最近几十年取得了很大的成绩。
- 中国政府对香港问题的态度，符合由民族历史塑造的民意。

我很乐于听到更多这样的声音，但我也相信蔡崇信的声音不会改变任何人的看法——美国人的，中国人的。世界的隔阂是很深的。
