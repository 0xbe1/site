# 陈易生

I am 陈易生 (Yik San Chan) and I go by "Evan" in English speaking environments.
I grew up in 惠州 (Huizhou), China and I work as a software developer living in San Francisco, US.
Besides coding, I also [write](https://yiksanchan.com/posts) to learn and teach.
I believe in what Richard Feynman said, "What I cannot create, I do not understand".

## Experience

Here are a list of what I did in a reverse chronological order.

- 2021/01-?: New journey in China.
- 2019/04-2020/12: Built Tubi's ad systems from scratch. Find more details in [this post](https://code.tubitv.com/a-fully-reactive-ad-serving-platform-using-scala-akka-streams-13299e7ea04e) and [another post](https://code.tubitv.com/a-fully-reactive-ad-serving-platform-using-scala-akka-streams-b2a3526be6a0) from my CTO.
- 2018/09-2019/04: Revamped [Twitter Ads API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api).
- 2018/05-2018/08: Interned at Google.
- 2018/02-2018/05: Interned at Twitter.
- 2017/05-2017/08: Interned at Amazon.
- 2016/08-2017/12: Master of Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University.

There are three major moves in my career.

- In 2021/01, me and my girlfriend 京含 made the decision to move back to China.
- In 2019/04, I joined a startup after working at several big tech companies. I compare the very different experience in [在创业公司做程序员是怎样一种体验？](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/166491761).
- In 2018/01, I became a software engineer in 16 months with an Economics background. I explain what I did and saw along the journey in [从经济系毕业生到硅谷程序员](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/164431792).

## Side hustles

海龟龟论坛 ([haiguigui.com](https://haiguigui.com/)) is a community where we share job market observations on both U.S. and China. I co-created it with my girlfriend 京含, because when we were looking for jobs in China, we hoped such a community existed.
